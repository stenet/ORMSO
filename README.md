# ORMSO

ORMSO is a library for currently three purposes:

* Mapping JavaScript objects to the database (currently Sqlite3 implemented but open for other databases)
* Syncing with other databases
* Publishing the data for clients (currently own implementation, basic odata implementation will follow)

I'll add more information on this as soon as the main work has been done and I'll find some free time ;-)
